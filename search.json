    "text": "2 Statistical Modeling: The Two Cultures - Leo Breiman\nThe article “Statistical Modeling: The Two Cultures” by Leo Breiman critiques the over-reliance on data modeling within traditional statistics and argues for greater use of algorithmic modeling (e.g., machine learning).\n\n2.1 Key Points:\n\nData modeling (parametric models, like regression) dominates traditional statistics.\n\nAlgorithmic modeling (machine learning, decision trees, random forests) is often better for prediction.\n\nWith the rise of large datasets, statisticians should broaden their methods.\n\nBreiman calls for a more flexible and diverse statistical toolbox."
