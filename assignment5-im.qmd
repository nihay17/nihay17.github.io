i.  

SELECT e.ID, e.person_name FROM employee e JOIN works w ON e.ID = w.ID JOIN company c ON w.company_name = c.company_name WHERE e.city = c.city;

ii. 

SELECT e.ID, e.person_name FROM employee e JOIN manages m ON e.ID = m.ID JOIN employee mgr ON m.manager_id = mgr.ID WHERE e.city = mgr.city AND e.street = mgr.street;

iii. 

SELECT w.ID, e.person_name FROM works w JOIN employee e ON w.ID = e.ID WHERE w.salary \> ( SELECT AVG(w2.salary) FROM works w2 WHERE w2.company_name = w.company_name );
